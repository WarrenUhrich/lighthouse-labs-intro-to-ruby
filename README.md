## Ruby!?!?!

* Everything is an object!
* Similarities to JavaScript
* Use with Rails (2005) MVC Framework
* Packages are called Gems
* Similarities to Python
* More verbal / easy-to-read
* Red and shiny, so pretty!
* Community has a good reputation
* Not as popular as it used to be (why learn it!?)

## About Ruby

* Interpreted scripting language
* General-purpose (but 2005 we saw it explode for use in web app development)
* 1995 Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz)
* Procedural or OOP are acceptable, but everything is an object!
* Synchronous

## Pros

* Accessible; easy to read and write
* Developer friendly
* Passionate community

## Cons

* Executes a bit slower than some competitors
* Its popularity is waning

## Essentials!

* Ruby files: `.rb`
* `ruby filename.rb`
* `irb` -> Interactive shell! Great for running scripts to see what happens...
* `snake_case` is the standard here.
* No more use for semi-colons, seldom see curly braces

## Command-Line Tools

* `irb`
* `ruby --version`
* `ruby -e 'RUBY CODE HERE'`
* `ruby filename.rb`
* `gem list`
