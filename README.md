## Have you Heard Anything About Ruby?

* Heard that it is OOP, and used for web-dev
* Full-stack but mainly focused on back-end
* Not that popular?

## What is Ruby?

* Interpreted, general-purpose
* Created in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto
* Ruby is entirely object-oriented... EVERYTHING in Ruby is an object
* Fairly strict compared to JavaScript - types matter!
* Made extremely popular in about 2005 due to the introduction of the VERY developer friendly MVC framework: Ruby on Rails
* Seen a LOT in CLI for Mac / Linux installations and scripts
* After '05, used a LOT for full-stack web!

> I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language. â€” Yukihiro Matsumoto

## Why NOT Pick Ruby?

* If another programming language does something better, then consider that one
* If objects aren't your thing!
* It is one of the slower popular interpreted languages
* Sometimes it is difficult to scale/grow your app

## Why pick Ruby?

* Everything is an object!
* Lots of libraries (Gems)
* Built to be easy to use / read
* Mature and very passionate community

## Command-Line!

* `ruby --version` prints active Ruby version
* `ruby -e 'RUBY CODE HERE'` execute the string as Ruby code
* `irb` runs the Interactive Ruby Shell, use `quit` to leave
* `ruby FILENAME.rb` execute a file by path/name
* `rvm docs generate` generates command-line documentation
* `ri CLASS_OR_METHOD_NAME` outputs built-in documentation (generate first!)
* `gem install GEM_NAME` installs a Ruby package (gem) globally
* `gem list` list all gems installed to this instance of Ruby
